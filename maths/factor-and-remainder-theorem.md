# Factor and Remainder Theorem

P\(x\) is a polynomial

## Factor Theorem \(basically same as the remainder theorem\)

- if P\(c\) = 0, \(x \- c\) is a factor
- if P\(b/a\) = 0, \(ax \- b\) is a factor

## Remainder Theorem

- if P\(x\) is divided by \(x \- c\), the remainder is P\(c\)
- if P\(x\) is divided by \(ax \- b\), the remainder is P\(b/a\)
