# Factor and Remainder Theorem

$P(x)$ is a polynomial

## Factor Theorem <small><sup><sub>(derived from remainder theorem)</sub></sup></small>

-   if $P(c) = 0$, $(x - c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$
-   if $P(\frac{b}{a}) = 0$, $(ax - b)$ is a factor of $P(x)$

## Remainder Theorem

-   if $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, the remainder is $P(c)$
-   if $P(x)$ is divided by $(ax - b)$, the remainder is $P(\frac{b}{a})$
