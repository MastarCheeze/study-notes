# Vectors

## Definition

A geometric object that has both magnitude and direction.

### Unit vector

A vector with magnitude 1, usually denoted by √Æ or ƒµ.

## Linear combinations

An operation that combines a set of vectors with scalar coefficients to create a new vector.

c1v1 \+ c2v2 \+ ... \+ cnvn

## Span

The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations that can be formed using those vectors.

## Linear independence

A set of vectors is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

There is only one unique set of scalar coefficients in a linear combination to obtain a specific vector.

Formally, the only way to obtain the zero vector using these vectors is by setting all the coefficients to zero.

c1v1 \+ c2v2 \+ ... \+ cnvn = ùüé

holds true if and only if a1 = a2 = ... = an = 0.

## Basis vectors

A set of linearly independent vectors that spans a vector space is the basis for the vector space.

### Examples

- √Æ and ƒµ are basis vectors of the xy coordinate system

## Subspace

A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space. \(See [Real Numbers & Real Coordinate Space](evernote:///view/242323586/s493/07248741-bb19-6cae-ba18-735b92397d9d/ed61c00f-9a64-860e-5ffe-da4064e956cf) for examples of vector spaces.\)

Must satisfy 3 conditions:

1. Contains the ùüé vector.
2. Closure under addition. \(Any two vectors in the set added together must equal another vector that is also in the set.\)
3. Closure under scalar multiplication. \(Any vector in the set multiplied by any scalar must equal another vector that is also in the set.\)

## Linear transformations

- Grid lines must be kept parallel and evenly spaced
    Transformed lines must be kept straight and not curved
- The origin must remain fixed in place

## Determinant

The determinant of a \(square\) matrix is how much the matrix transformation changes the area of the transformed object.
