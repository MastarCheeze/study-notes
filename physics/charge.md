# Charge

`electricity`

**Conventional current direction**: current travels from + to -. \
**Electron flow direction**: electrons travel from - to +.

## Electric field

- **Region where force acts on a charge**
- +ve â†’ -ve

## Electrostatic charges

Ways to charge an object:

- Friction
- Conduction (objects touching, electrons transferring)
- Induction (objects not touching, electrons transferring via another object or earthing)
