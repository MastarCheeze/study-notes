# Heat Transfer

## Conduction

**Heat transfer in solids**

### Metals

<p></p>
Metals are good conductors because:

- mobile electrons gain kinetic energy
- move randomly and collide, transfer kinetic energy

## Convection

**Heat transfer in fluids** (liquid & gas)

### Convection current

![Convection current](images/convection-current.png)

1. Water is heated from the bottom
2. Hot water rises
3. Cool water sinks
4. Cool water is heated at the bottom
5. Circulation

### Sea breeze and land breeze

<p></p>
Sea breeze

- Daytime
- Lands heats up more quickly than the sea
- Warm air from the land rises, displaced by cooler air from the sea

<p></p>
Land breeze

- Nighttime
- Land cools off more quickly than the sea
- Warm air from the sea rises, displaced by cooler air from the land

## Radiation

**Heat transfer (via infrared rays) without a medium**

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{surface~area} &\propto \mathrm{energy~radiated} \\
  \mathrm{temperature} &\propto \mathrm{energy~radiated}
\end{aligned}
$$

Dark & dull = good absorber / emitter \
White & shiny = bad absorber / emitter (good reflectors)
