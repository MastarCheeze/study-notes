# Latent heat \*

The heat or energy that is absorbed or released during a phase change of a substance (when the temperature doesn't change)

### Specific latent heat

> $$
> \begin{align*}
>   E &= mL \\
>   \mathrm{energy~transferred} &= \mathrm{mass \cdot specific~latent~heat}

> Unit: J/kg \
> Energy required to transform 1 kg of mass to the next state

Specific latent heat of fusion - solid ⇄ liquid \
Specific latent heat of vaporisation - liquid ⇄ gas
