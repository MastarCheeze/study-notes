# Terminal Velocity

1. In a free fall, the forces are:
    - Weight - downwards force
    - Air resistance (friction) - upwards force
2. When velocity increases, air resistance also increases
3. When air resistance is equal to the weight, the resultant force is zero
4. Acceleration is zero (Follows [Newton's Laws of Motion](./newtons-laws-of-motion.md#first-law))
