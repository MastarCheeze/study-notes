> **Why is there acceleration?** - There is resultant force

### What is acceleration

-   Rate of change of **increase** of **velocity**

### What is deceleration

-   Negative acceleration
-   Negative rate of change of velocity

### Effects of force

-   Change **speed**
-   Change **direction**
-   Change **rotational force** (torque)
-   Change **shape**

### What is mass

Amount of matter

### What is weight

Force of gravity acting on an object

### Compare weight with mass

-   Is vector
-   Has direction
-   Is force
-   Varies

### Motion and arrangement of particles in solids, liquids and gases

-   Arrangement
    -   Solid - fixed position / lattice
    -   Liquid - irregular pattern
    -   Gas - have wide separation
-   Motion
    -   Solid - vibrate
    -   Liquid - slide over each other
    -   Gas - move randomly and quickly

### Why liquids/solids hard to compress

-   Molecules close together
-   Large repulsive forces

### Why liquids expand/contract more than solid, gas expand/contract more than liquid

-   Attraction forces between molecules weaker/stronger
-   Greater/less distance between molecules

### Factors of evaporation

-   Surface area of liquid
-   Temperature of liquid / surroundings
-   Humidity of surroundings
-   Draughts

### How does evaporation cool

-   Heat transfer to liquid molecules
-   Molecules with high KE escape at surface of liquid
-   Remaining molecules have
    -   lower **average** KE
    -   lower speed
    -   lower temperature

### How is energy lost (friction)

-   KE decreases
-   Friction transfer KE to heat energy
-   Heat <u>lost to surroundings</u>

### What is Brownian motion

-   _Molecules_ move randomly
-   _Molecules_ move fast
-   _Molecules_ are small / light
-   Bombard / collide with smoke/dust _particles_
-   Change in momentum over time, exert force in random directions

### Why forward force changes when maintaining uniform acceleration

Friction increases as speed increases

### What is limit of proportionality

Extension proportional to load (obey Hooke's Law) up to this limit

### How is pressure formed

-   Molecules move randomly
-   Collide with walls
-   **Change in momentum over time** that exerts force

### How does momentum change force

-   Momentum changes
-   Resultant force = rate of change of momentum

### What is power

Rate of doing work

### What is specific thermal capacity \*

Energy needed to raise temperature by 1˚C

### What is internal energy

Total kinetic and potential energy of all molecules

### What is specific latent heat of fusion/vaporisation \*

-   Amount of energy **transferred**
-   To melt or freeze / boil or condense

### Why metals conduct heat

-   <u>Atoms</u> **vibrate**, collide with neighbouring atoms and transfer energy
-   Mobile <u>electrons</u> **move freely** through metal, collide with atoms and transfer energy

### What is transverse wave

Oscillations perpendicular to direction of travel

### What is longitudinal wave

Oscillations parallel to direction of travel

### What is rarefaction

Part of wave where **pressure** is low \
and molecules are closer together

### What is compression

Part of wave where **pressure** is high \
and molecules are further apart

### What is critical angle

Angle of incidence where angle of refraction is 90˚

### What is monochromatic

Light/electromagnetic waves of <u>single</u> frequency

### Features of a virtual image

-   Cannot be projected on screen
-   (Real rays) do not converge

### What is electric field

Region where electric charge experience force

### What is magnetic field

Region which magnetic pole experiences force \
Region which magnetic material experiences force

### What is p.d.

Work done (J) to push 1C of electric charge <u>between 2 points in a circuit</u> \
Work done (J) to push 1C of electric charge through an <u>electrical component</u>

### What is e.m.f.

Work done (J) to push 1C of electric charge through the <u>complete circuit</u>

### How is current/voltage induced

-   **Magnetic field lines cut**
-   E.m.f. **induced**
-   Induced current opposes motion
-   Force, magnetic field and induced current mutually perpendicular

### How does transformer work

-   AC in primary coil
-   Causes alternating magnetic field in iron core
-   Iron core concentrates magnetic field
-   **<u>Changing</u> magnetic field cuts secondary coil**
-   E.m.f. **induced**

### Why high voltage is used for electricity transmission

1.  Current low
2.  Power loss low $\mathrm{(P=I^2R)}$ \
    Less heat energy lost
3.  Diameter of wire can be reduced \
    Cheaper cost

### How to demagnetise a magnet

Place magnet in coil with AC, slowly reduce current to 0

### How does potential divider work

-   Resistance of _resistor_ increase/decrease
-   Voltage of midpoint increase/decrease
-   Current that flows through _output component_ increase/decrease

### What is potential divider

-   Divides voltage
-   Split between 2 resistors
-   In proportion to their resistances

### Advantages of using digital signals instead of analogue

-   Less noise
-   Faster transmission
-   Longer distance of transmission

### What is renewable

-   Replaced easily
-   Never runs out

### Disadvantage of solar/wind

-   Intermittent power supply (not consistent)

### Why is isotope stable

Fewer excess neutrons in nucleus

### How to determine distance of celestial object from Earth

-   Redshift
-   Brightness

### What can be deduced from CMBR

-   CMBR is microwave radiation at all points in space
-   Produced when universe is formed
-   Radiation expanded and red-shifted into microwave
-   Evidence that universe expanded

### Precautions of measuring (thermometer)

-   View scale perpendicularly
    -   Avoid parallax error
-   Stir before reading
