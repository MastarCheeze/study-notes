### What is deceleration?
- Negative acceleration
- Negative rate of change of velocity

### What is mass?
Amount of matter

### What is weight?
Force of gravity acting on an object

### Compare weight with mass
- Is vector
- Has direction
- Is force
- Varies

### Motion and arrangement of particles in solids, liquids and gases
- Arrangement
    - Solid - fixed position / lattice
    - Liquid - irregular pattern
    - Gas - have wide separation
- Motion
    - Solid - vibrate
    - Liquid - slide over each other
    - Gas - move randomly and quickly

### What is Brownian motion?
- *Molecules* move randomly
- *Molecules* move fast
- *Molecules* are small / light
- Bombard / collide with smoke/dust *particles*
- Change in momentum, exert force in random directions

### Why forward force changes when maintaining uniform acceleration?
Friction increases as speed increases

### How is pressure formed?
- Molecules move randomly
- Collide with walls
- **Change in momentum** that exerts force

### How does momentum change force?
- Momentum changes
- Resultant force = rate of change of momentum

### What is power?
Rate of doing work

### What is thermal capacity?
Energy needed to raise temperature by 1˚C

### What is internal energy?
Total kinetic and potential energy of all molecules

### How does evaporation cool?
- Molecules with high KE escape at surface of liquid
- Remaining molecules have
    - lower **average** KE
    - lower speed
    - lower temperature

### What is transverse wave?
Oscillations perpendicular to direction of travel

### What is longitudinal wave?
Oscillations parallel to direction of travel

### What is rarefaction?
Part of wave where pressure is low

### What is compression?
Part of wave where pressure is high

### What is critical angle?
Angle of incidence where angle of refraction is 90˚

### What is monochromatic?
Light/electromagnetic waves of same frequency

### Features of a virtual image
- Cannot be projected on screen
- (Real rays) do not converge

### What is electric field?
Region where force acts on a charge

### What is magnetic field?
Region which magnetic pole experiences force

### How is current/voltage induced?
- **Magnetic field lines cut**
- Current/voltage **induced**
- Induced current opposes motion
- Force, magnetic field and induced current mutually perpendicular

### How does transformer work?
- AC in primary coil
- Causes alternating magnetic field in iron core
- Iron core concentrates magnetic field
- **Alternating magnetic field cuts secondary coil**
- Current/voltage **induced**

### How to demagnetise a magnet?
Connect to AC and slowly reduce current to 0

### How does potential divider work?
- Resistance of *resistor* increase/decrease
- Voltage of midpoint increase/decrease
- Current that flows through *output component* increase/decrease

### Why metals conduct heat?
- Mobile electrons move through metal, high energy
- Ions in lattice vibrate

### What is potential divider?
- Divides voltage
- Split between 2 resistors
- In proportion to their resistances

### Advantages of using digital signals instead of analogue
- Less noise
- Faster transmission
- Longer distance of transmission

### Why is isotope stable?
Fewer excess neutrons in nucleus
