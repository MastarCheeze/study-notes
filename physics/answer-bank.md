### What is deceleration
- Negative acceleration
- Negative rate of change of velocity

### What is mass
Amount of matter

### What is weight
Force of gravity acting on an object

### Compare weight with mass
- Is vector
- Has direction
- Is force
- Varies

### Motion and arrangement of particles in solids, liquids and gases
- Arrangement
    - Solid - fixed position / lattice
    - Liquid - irregular pattern
    - Gas - have wide separation
- Motion
    - Solid - vibrate
    - Liquid - slide over each other
    - Gas - move randomly and quickly

### Why liquids/solids hard to compress
- Molecules close together
- Large repulsive forces

### Why liquids expand more than solid / gas expand more than liquid
- Forces between molecules stronger/weaker
- More/less energy to separate molecules

### What is Brownian motion
- *Molecules* move randomly
- *Molecules* move fast
- *Molecules* are small / light
- Bombard / collide with smoke/dust *particles*
- Change in momentum, exert force in random directions

### Why forward force changes when maintaining uniform acceleration
Friction increases as speed increases

### What is limit of proportionality
Extension proportional to load (obey Hooke's Law) up to this limit

### How is pressure formed
- Molecules move randomly
- Collide with walls
- **Change in momentum** that exerts force

### How does momentum change force
- Momentum changes
- Resultant force = rate of change of momentum

### What is power
Rate of doing work

### What is specific thermal capacity
Energy needed to raise temperature by 1˚C

### What is internal energy
Total kinetic and potential energy of all molecules

### What is specific latent heat of fusion/vaporisation
- Amount of energy **transferred**
- To melt or freeze / boil or condense

### How does evaporation cool
- Molecules with high KE escape at surface of liquid
- Remaining molecules have
    - lower **average** KE
    - lower speed
    - lower temperature

### Why metals conduct heat
- Ions in lattice vibrate, transfer energy to neighbouring ions & electrons
- Mobile electrons propagate through metal, high energy

### What is transverse wave
Oscillations perpendicular to direction of travel

### What is longitudinal wave
Oscillations parallel to direction of travel

### What is rarefaction
Part of wave where pressure is low

### What is compression
Part of wave where pressure is high

### What is critical angle
Angle of incidence where angle of refraction is 90˚

### What is monochromatic
Light/electromagnetic waves of same frequency

### Features of a virtual image
- Cannot be projected on screen
- (Real rays) do not converge

### What is electric field
Region where charges experience force

### What is magnetic field
Region which magnetic pole experiences force

### What is e.m.f.
Energy supplied to drive 1C of charge

### How is current/voltage induced
- **Magnetic field lines cut**
- Current/voltage **induced**
- Induced current opposes motion
- Force, magnetic field and induced current mutually perpendicular

### How does transformer work
- AC in primary coil
- Causes alternating magnetic field in iron core
- Iron core concentrates magnetic field
- **Alternating magnetic field cuts secondary coil**
- Current/voltage **induced**

### How to demagnetise a magnet
Place magnet in coil with AC, slowly reduce current to 0

### How does potential divider work
- Resistance of *resistor* increase/decrease
- Voltage of midpoint increase/decrease
- Current that flows through *output component* increase/decrease

### What is potential divider
- Divides voltage
- Split between 2 resistors
- In proportion to their resistances

### Advantages of using digital signals instead of analogue
- Less noise
- Faster transmission
- Longer distance of transmission

### Why is isotope stable
Fewer excess neutrons in nucleus

### How to determine distance of celestial object from Earth
- Redshift
- Brightness

> ### Measuring
>
> - Accurate to accuracy of measuring instrument - e.g. $0.50\text{A}$
>
> #### Matching results
> - Values within 10% of each other
> - $\displaystyle\mathrm{\frac{smaller~number}{larger~number}} \geq 0.9$
>   - Equal, within **limits of experimental accuracy**
> - $\displaystyle\mathrm{\frac{smaller~number}{larger~number}} \lt 0.9$
>   - Not equal, beyond **limits of experimental accuracy**
>
> ### Graphs
>
> - Axes with label and unit - e.g. $R/Ω$
> - Points spread >50% of graph
> - Thin line of best fit, does not have to go through points
> - Scale does not have to start at 0 (depends on question)
> - **Predict points**
>   - Lines on graph
> - **Finding gradients**
>   - Triangle method on graph
>   - \>50% of graph
>
> #### Proportionality
>
> - Straight line
> - Passes through origin

### Why taking average is more accurate
- Less error

### Why graph is more accurate
- Method of averaging
- Outliers can be seen easily
- Less error

### Precautions of measuring (thermometer)
- View scale perpendicularly
    - Avoid parallax error
- Stir before reading
    - Ensure same temperature throughout liquid
- Avoid touching sides with thermometer
    - Temperature is different from liquid

### Precautions of measuring (measuring cylinder)
- View scale perpendicularly
    - Avoid parallax error
- Read bottom of meniscus
- Ensure cylinder on horizontal surface

### Precautions of ray-trace experiment
- Pins as far apart as possible (5-15cm)
- Thin pins
- Thin lines drawn
- Upright pins
- Look at base of pins
- Darker room / brighter light

### Precautions of lens focus experiment
- Move lens forwards/backwards <u>slowly</u>
- Ensure object, lens & screen all perpendicular
- Darker room / brighter light
