# Magnetic Fields

- **Region where magnetic pole experiences force**
- N â†’ S
- Closer field lines = stronger field

## Magnetic fields of wires

> Wires produce weak magnetic field \
> (see [Right hand grip rule](#right-hand-grip-rule))

### Solenoid

> Coils of wires \
> Amplifies magnetic field \
> (see [Right hand grip rule](#right-hand-grip-rule))

<p></p>
To increase strength of electromagnet:

- Increase current
- Increase number of turns (coil)
- Increase size of core

## Force on wire

> When electrons are in magnetic field \
> force is exerted \
> (see [Fleming's left hand rule](#flemings-left-hand-rule))

<p></p>
To increase force on wire:

- Increase current
- Increase number of turns (coil)
- Stronger magnet
- Increase area (coil)

## Induced current in wire

> When wire **cuts through magnetic field** \
> e.m.f. is induced, which causes current \
> (see [Fleming's right hand rule](#flemings-right-hand-rule))
>
> #### Faraday's law
> $$\text{e.m.f. induced in conductor} \propto \text{magnetic field line cutting rate}$$
>
> #### Lenz's law
> Induced current always flows in direction that opposes change

<p></p>
To increase induced current:

- Stronger magnet
- Increase movement speed
- Increase area of wire

<p></p>
To reverse induced current:

- Movement in opposite direction
- Reverse poles of magnet

### Solenoid

> Poles oppose change \
> (see [Lenz's law](#lenzs-law))

### Eddy current

> Created when metals cut through magnetic fields lines \
> Produces motion that opposes change

# Applications

## Electromagnets

- Laminated soft iron core
    - **Soft** magnetic material (easily magnetised/demagnetised)

## Electric motors

- Split ring commutator
    - **Reverses direction of current** every half turn \
      so coil keeps rotating in one direction
- Brushes
    - Carbon

## Generators

- Slip ring
- Brushes
    - Carbon

## Transformers

- Laminated soft iron core

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{V_p}{N_p} &= \frac{V_s}{N_s} \\
  \mathrm{\frac{primary~voltage}{turns~in~primary~coil}} &= \mathrm{\frac{secondary~voltage}{turns~in~secondary~coil}} \\
  \\
  V_pI_p &= V_sI_s ~ \scriptsize\text{(power is constant)} \\
  \mathrm{input~voltage \cdot input~current} &= \mathrm{output~voltage \cdot output~current}
\end{align*}
