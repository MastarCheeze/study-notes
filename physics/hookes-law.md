# Hooke's Law

> $$
\begin{aligned}
  F &= kx \\

\end{aligned}

> Unit of k: N/m

A material obeys Hooke's law if **extension is directly proportional to load** (below limit of proportionality)

## Limit of proportionality

Hooke's law is obeyed up until this point

## Elastic limit

Material is permanently stretched beyond this point
