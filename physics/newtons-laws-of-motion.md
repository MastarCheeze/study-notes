# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law

A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.

## Second Law

When a body is acted upon by a net force, the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass is equal to the net force.

> 1 N is the force required to give a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>

## Third Law

Every action force has a reaction force of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction.
