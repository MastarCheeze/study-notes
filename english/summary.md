# Summary

Find main points from the text and write it in 1 paragraph only. Must not exceed 130 words.

Usually 10-12 points. If there are 2 focuses, split the points according to their importance/frequency in the text.

Must use your own words, but do not change the meaning of the point too much. A negative point can be flipped positive and vice versa to be used in the summary.

Needs to be **concise** and **structured**. Group points together to save on word count.

## Step-by-step

### Annotation

1. Find points and annotate with numbers
    - If have 2 focuses, separate annotations for 1st and 2nd focus (eg. 1a, 1b)
2. Group focuses that are similar

### Writing

3. Start the first sentence of a focus by repeating the focus
4. Use conjunctions between sentences (sparingly)
