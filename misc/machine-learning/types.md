# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

The algorithm learns from a labelled dataset to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Regression

Predict results with continuous numeric output

### Classification

Classify inputs into discrete categories

## Unsupervised Learning

Learn patterns from unlabelled data.

### Clustering

Group similar data points together based on their characteristics.

## Reinforcement learning
