# Transmission

## Serial

-   Single wire
-   One bit at a time

## Parallel

-   Multiple wires
-   Multiple bits simultaneously

| Serial                                          | Parallel                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Longer wire                                  | ❌ Shorter wire                         |
| ✅ Cheap                                        | ❌ Expensive                            |
| ✅ Less error                                   | ❌ More error                           |
| ✅ Less skew <br> (arrive in order)             | ❌ More skew <br> (arrive in order)     |
| ✅ Less interference <br> (single wire)         | ❌ More interference <br> (single wire) |
| ❌ Slow                                         | ✅ Fast                                 |
| ❌ Additional data needed <br> (start/stop bit) |                                         |

# Direction

## Simplex

-   Transmission in one direction only

## Half-duplex

-   Transmission in both directions
-   But only one at a time

## Full-duplex

-   Transmission in both directions
-   At the same time

<br>

# Universal serial bus (USB)

-   Industry standard used to transmit data
-   High-speed
-   Serial
    -   Single wire
    -   One bit at a time

|                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Universal standard                     |
| ✅ Fast                                   |
| ✅ Supports different transmission speeds |
| ✅ Can only fit one way                   |
| ✅ Backwards compatible                   |
| ✅ Automatically detect/download drivers  |
| ✅ Can charge device                      |
| ❌ Limited transmission rate (500Mb/s)    |
| ❌ Limited length (5m)                    |
