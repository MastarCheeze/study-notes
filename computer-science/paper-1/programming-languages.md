# Programming Language

## Low-level

> Close to machine language \
> Machine dependent \
> No need to be translated

-   Machine code
-   Assembly
    -   Uses mnemonics
    -   Assembler to translate into machine code

## High-level

> Close to human language \
> Machine independent \
> Needs to be translated

-   Python
-   Java
-   VB.NET

| Low-level                                                    | High-level                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Does not need translating <br> (assembly translates fast) | ❌ Needs translating                 |
| ✅ Can directly manipulate memory                            | ❌ Cannot directly manipulate memory |
| ❌ Hard to read/write                                        | ✅ Easy to read/write                |
| ❌ Hard to debug                                             | ✅ Easy to debug                     |
| ❌ Machine dependent (not portable)                          | ✅ Machine independent (portable)    |
| ❌ More code needed                                          | ✅ Less code needed                  |

# Translators

> High-level → machine code

## Compiler

> Translates whole code at once before executing \
> Produces executable file

## Interpreter

> Translates/executes code line by line

## Assembler

> Assembly → machine code

<br>

| Writing program: Interpreter ✅          |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| Code does not have to be complete to run |
| Reports error one at a time              |
| Easier to debug                          |
| Can fix errors during runtime            |

<br>

| Distributing program: Compiler ✅                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Produces executable file                               |
| Does not need translator to run                        |
| Does not need source code to run                       |
| Does not need to re-translate code each time it is run |
| Code cannot be viewed/edited                           |
