# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

> Simulation of intelligent behaviours by computers

<p></p>
Features

-   Collection of data and rules
-   Ability to **reason** (logic)
-   Ability to **learn**[^1]

## Machine learning

> Improves by training

<p></p>
Can

-   Adapt its own processes
-   Learn from its mistakes
-   Change its own data and rules
-   Analyse patterns

<p></p>
Types

-   [Supervised](../misc/machine-learning/types.md#supervised-learning)
    -   Training data is labelled
-   [Unsupervised](../misc/machine-learning/types.md#unsupervised-learning)
    -   Training data is unlabelled

## Expert system

> System that replicates the knowledge of an expert

-   Knowledge base
    -   Stores facts (for inference engine)
-   Rule base
    -   Stores rules (for inference engine)
    -   Used to link facts in knowledge base
-   Inference engine
    -   Apply **rule base** to **knowledge base** \
        to provide results/diagnosis
    -   Decides what to ask next
-   Interface
    -   Input data
    -   View output
