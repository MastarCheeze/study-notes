# Program Development Cycle

<p></p>
Types:

- Cyclic
- Spiral
- Waterfall
- Rapid development

## 1. Analysis

> Identify problem & requirements

### Decomposition

Split a system into sub-systems, \
split sub-systems into smaller sub-systems

### Abstraction

Simplifying \
Select important elements \
Removing unneccesary characteristics from elements

## 2. Design

> Design algorithm

### Structure diagram

### Flowchart

### Pseudocode

See [Pseudocode](./pseudocode.md)

## 3. Coding

> Writing program

## 4. Testing

> Detect/fix errors

| Test data |                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal    | Accepted by program                                                 |
| Abnormal  | Rejected by program                                                 |
| Extreme   | On the edge of what is allowed, accepted by program                 |
| Boundary  | On the edge of what is allowed, both accepted & rejected by program |
