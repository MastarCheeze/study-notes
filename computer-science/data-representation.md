## Compression

- Less storage
- Faster transmission
- Faster upload/download time
- Less bandwith required

#### Lossless

> Reduce file size without permanent loss of data

- Perceptual music shaping
    - Removes sounds that cannot be heard by the human ear

#### Lossy

> Reduce file size by permanently removing data

- Run length encoding (RLE)
    - Groups together repeating patterns
    - Indexes them
