> 1. *Sensor* measures *quantity*
> 2. Data sent to microprocessor
> 3. Convert from analogue to digital \
>    using **ADC**
> 4. Value compared with preset value
> 5. If value ***matches / within range / outside range***
> 6. *Scenario 1*, **signal** sent to cause *action* \
>    *Scenario 2*, **signal** sent to cause *action* \
>    *Scenario 3*, no action
> 7. **Actuator** operates *device*
> 8. **Whole** process is **continuous until stopped** (depends)

### Why can computers only process binary
- Transistors
- Can only store 0 and 1

### What is off-line storage
- Non-volatile
- Not directly accessed by CPU
- Can be easily disconnected
- Example
    - CD / DVD
    - Flash drive

### Why is virtual memory needed
- Extend RAM capacity
- Process more data
- Prevent *application* from freezing

### How is data accidentally lost
- Physical damage
- Hardware failure
- Software failure
- Power surge
- Human error
- Accidentally delete
- Ejecting drive incorrectly

### How to prevent accidental data loss
- Backup
- Protection case
- Update software
- Surge protection (UPS[^UPS])
- Verify when delete file
- Eject drive correctly

### Why are cookies concerning
- Data collection
- Privacy concern
- Identity theft
- Sensitive information stolen

### Why separate presentation from structure
- Change formatting without changing structure
- Formatting can be reused
- Standardise formatting across web pages

# Paper 2

### What happens when a function is called
- Call statement used
- Parameters passed (optional)
- Functions perform task
- Returns value

### Why store data in file
- Permanent storage
- Can be transferred between computers
- Can create copy of data
