> ## Techniques
>
> ### Application of sensors
>
> 1. [_Sensor_] measures [_quantity_] continuously
> 2. Data sent to microprocessor
> 3. Convert from analogue to digital \
>    using **ADC**
> 4. Value **compared** with **stored value** of [_concrete value_]
> 5. If value **_matches / within range / outside range_**
> 6. [_Scenario 1_], **signal** sent to cause [_action_] \
>    [_Scenario 2_], **signal** sent to cause [_action_] \
>    [_Scenario 3_], no action
> 7. **Actuator** operates [_device_]
> 8. **Whole** process is **continuous until stopped** (depends)
>
> ### Advantages/Disadvantages
>
> For advantages, can say that disadvantage does not affect use case
>
> **Example:** Parallel data transmission not needed because only transmit for short distance

### Why can computers only process binary

-   Transistors
-   Can only store 0 and 1

### What are registers

-   Memory
-   Store data and instructions

### What is off-line storage

-   Non-volatile
-   Not directly accessed by CPU
-   Can be easily disconnected
-   Example
    -   CD / DVD
    -   Flash drive

### Why is virtual memory needed

-   Extend RAM capacity
-   Process more data
-   Prevent [_application_] from freezing

### How are interrupts processed

1.  Interrupt sent to CPU
2.  CPU stops current task
    To service interrupt
3.  CPU calls interrupt service routine (ISR)
4.  Action is produced

### How is data accidentally lost

-   Physical damage
-   Hardware failure
-   Software failure
-   Power surge
-   Human error
-   Accidentally delete
-   Ejecting drive incorrectly

### How to prevent accidental data loss

-   Backup
-   Protection case
-   Update software
-   Surge protection (UPS[^UPS])
-   Verify when delete file
-   Eject drive correctly

### Why are cookies concerning

-   Data collection
-   Privacy concern
-   Identity theft
-   Sensitive information stolen

### Why separate presentation from structure

-   Change formatting without changing structure
-   Formatting can be reused
-   Standardise formatting across web pages

# Paper 2

> ALWAYS WRITE OUTPUT

### What happens when a function is called

-   Call statement used
-   Parameters passed (optional)
-   Functions perform task
-   Returns value

### Why store data in file

-   Permanent storage
-   Can be transferred between computers
-   Can create copy of data
