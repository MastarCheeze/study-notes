| Arrangement | Regular (lattice)         | Irregular             | Irregular        |
| Movement    | Vibrate in fixed position | Slide past each other | Move randomly    |

## Heating/Cooling Curve

![Heating/cooling curve](images/heating-curve.png)

Temperature is constant during change of physical state (B → C, D → E) because:

> **Heating**: Heat energy is used to break bonds (potential energy) instead of increasing temperature (kinetic energy)

> **Cooling**: Energy is released from forming bonds (potential energy) instead of from decreasing temperature (kinetic energy)

## Diffusion

> Particles move in random directions

⬇ mass ⬆ diffusion speed
