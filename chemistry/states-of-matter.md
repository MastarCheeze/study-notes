# States of Matter

### Solid

-   Lattice
-   Vibrate in fixed position

### Liquid

-   Slide past each other

### Gas

-   Move quickly and randomly

## Heating/Cooling Curve

![Heating/cooling curve](images/heating-curve.png)

Temperature is constant during change of physical state (B → C, D → E) because:

> **Heating**: Heat energy is used to break bonds (potential energy) instead of increasing temperature (kinetic energy)

> **Cooling**: Energy is released from forming bonds (potential energy) instead of from decreasing temperature (kinetic energy)

## Diffusion

> Particles move in random directions

⬇ mass ⬆ diffusion speed
