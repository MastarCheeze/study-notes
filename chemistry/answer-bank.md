# Paper 4

### Why is a chemical reaction

-   New substance made
-   Cannot be reversed by physical process

### What is boiling/melting/condensation/freezing point

-   Constant temperature
-   _state change_ <small>(liquid → gas)</small>
-   heat absorbed/released

### Evaporation vs boiling

-   Boiling occurs throughout liquid, evaporation only occurs on surface of liquid
-   Boiling only occurs at specific temperature (boiling point), evaporation occurs at range of temperatures
-   Boiling has bubbles, evaporation doesn't

### Why substance cannot be identified in chromatogram

Similar $\mathrm{R_f}$ values

### What is redox

Reduction and oxidation both occur

### Why it is redox reaction

_particle_ lose electrons, _particle_ gain electron

### Why _ion_ has charge _charge_

_number_ more/less electrons than protons

### What are isotopes

-   Atoms of the same element (same proton number)
-   Different number of neutrons

### Why have similar chemical properties

Same number of outer shell (valence) electrons

### What is water of crystallisation

Water molecules present in hydrated crystals

### Why crystals form in crystallisation

Solubility ⬇ as temperature ⬇

### Chemical name of rust

Hydrated iron (III) oxide

### What is equilibrium

-   Rate of forwards/backwards reaction is equal
-   Concentration of reactant/product constant
-   Closed system

### What is closed system

No substance can enter or leave during a reaction

### What is activation energy

-   **Minimum** energy colliding particles must have
-   to react

### Why increasing temperature increases rate of reaction

-   More kinetic energy
-   Frequency of collision ⬆
-   Higher percentage particles have energy higher than activation energy

### Why increase surface area increases rate of reaction

-   Larger surface area
-   Frequency of collision ⬆

### Why increase concentration increases rate of reaction

-   More particles per unit volume
-   Frequency of collision ⬆

### Why rate of reaction decrease over time

-   Concentration decrease
-   Frequency of collision ⬇

### What is saturated solution

-   Maximum amount of solute dissolved
-   At certain temperature

### What is acid

Proton donor

### What is base

Proton acceptor

### What is electrolysis

-   Breakdown using electricity of
-   molten / aqueous ionic compound (electrolyte)

### What is electrolyte

-   Ionic compound
-   Molten / aqueous

### Why is cryolite used

-   Lower melting point
-   Increase conductivity
-   Solvent for aluminium oxide

### Disadvantage of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell

Hydrogen stored under high pressure as a liquid

### Why [ionic compound] has higher melting point than [covalent compound]

-   Ionic compound - ionic bond \
    stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between ions
-   Covalent compound - covalent bond \
    weaker intermolecular forces of attraction
-   More energy needed to break bond

### Why metals conduct electricity

Mobile electrons

### Why aqueous/molten ionic compound conducts electricity

Mobile ions

### What are physical properties of ionic compound

-   High melting/boiling point
-   Soluble in water (depends)
-   Good electrical conductor when molten/aqueous

### Describe bonding in metallic element

-   Positive ions arranged in lattice
-   Sea of delocalised electrons
-   Electrostatic attraction force between positive ion and electron

### What are chemical properties of transition elements

-   Variable oxidation number
-   Forms coloured compounds
-   Catalyst

### What are physical properties of transition elements

-   Higher melting point
-   Higher density
-   Harder

### Why aluminium does not react immediately with acid

Aluminium oxide layer on surface

### Why copper used for wires

-   Good electrical conductor
-   Ductile
-   Unreactive

### Why aluminium used for overhead cables

-   Low density
-   Good conductor of electricity

### Uses of ammonium nitrate / ammonium phosphate

Synthetic fertiliser

# Paper 6

> ### Question 4
>
> -   Apparatus
> -   Specific amount of substance
> -   Specific concentration of acid/alkali
> -   Specific temperature

### How can reliability of experiment be confirmed

**Repeat** and **compare**

### Why use white tile

See colour change clearer

### Why rinse _apparatus_ with _solution_

Remove water

### Why run some _solution_ out of burette

-   Make sure level of _solution_ is on scale
-   Fill the tip of burette

### Why remove delivery tube from water

-   Water gets sucked back into tube
-   Boiling tube cracks

### Why measure more frequently

-   More data points
-   Smoother graph

### How to not remove bung when mixing

-   Divided flask
-   Tip to mix

### Why use pencil to draw line (chromatography)

Insoluble

### When to remove chromatography paper

When solvent is almost at the top

### How to separate sugars from carbohydrates \*

Chromatography

### How to increase accuracy (25cm<sup>3</sup>)

<u>Volumetric</u> pipette

### How to know water is fully given off

-   Heat and reweigh
-   Until constant mass

### How to do flame test

-   Wooden splint with substance
-   Blue flame
-   Put splint into flame
-   Observe colour of flame
