### Why it is redox reaction

_particle_ lose electrons, _particle_ gain electron

### Why _ion_ has charge _charge_

_number_ more/less electrons than protons

### What are isotopes

-   Atoms of the same element (same proton number)
-   Different number of neutrons

### Why have similar chemical properties

Same number of outer shell (valence) electrons

### What is equilibrium

-   Rate of forwards/backwards reaction is equal
-   Concentration of reactant/product constant
-   Closed system

### What is activation energy

-   Minimum energy colliding particles must have
-   to react

### Why increasing temperature increases rate of reaction

-   More kinetic energy
-   Collide more
-   More particles have energy higher than activation energy

### Why increase surface area increases rate of reaction

-   Larger surface area
-   Collide more

### Why increase concentration increases rate of reaction

-   More particles in smaller volume
-   Collide more

### What is saturated solution

-   Maximum amount of solute dissolved
-   At certain temperature

### What is acid

Proton donor

### What is base

Proton acceptor

### What is electrolysis

-   Breakdown using electricity
-   Molten / aqueous ionic compound (electrolyte)

### What is electrolyte

-   Ionic compound
-   Molten / aqueous

### Why is cryolite used

-   Lower melting point
-   Increase conductivity
-   Solvent for aluminium oxide

### Disadvantage of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell

Hydrogen stored under high pressure as a liquid

### Why [ionic compound] has higher melting point than [covalent compound]

-   Ionic compound - ionic bond \
    stronger electrostatic forces of attraction (between +ve and -ve ion)
-   Covalent compound - covalent bond \
    weaker intermolecular forces of attraction
-   More energy needed to break bond

### Why metals conduct electricity

Mobile electrons

### Why aqueous/molten ionic compound conducts electricity

Mobile ions

### What are physical properties of ionic compound

-   High melting/boiling point
-   Soluble in water (depends)
-   Good electrical conductor when molten/aqueous

### Describe bonding in metallic element

-   Positive ions arranged in lattice
-   Sea of delocalised electrons
-   Electrostatic force between positive ion and electron

### What are chemical properties of transition elements

-   Variable oxidation number
-   Forms coloured compounds
-   Catalyst

### What are physical properties of transition elements

-   Higher melting point
-   Higher density
-   Stronger

### What is catalyst

-   Increase rate of reaction
-   Remains unchanged

### Why aluminium does not react immediately with acid

Oxidation layer on surface

### Uses of ammonium nitrate / ammonium phosphate

Synthetic fertiliser

# Paper 6

### How can reliability of experiment be confirmed

**Repeat** and **compare**

### Why use white tile

See colour change clearer

### Why rinse _apparatus_ with _solution_

Remove water

### Why run some _solution_ out of burette

-   Make sure level of _solution_ is on scale
-   Fill the tip of burette

### Why measure more frequently

Smoother graph

### How to not remove bung when mixing

-   Divided flask
-   Tip to mix

### Why use pencil to draw line (chromatography)

Insoluble

### How to increase accuracy (25cm<sup>3</sup>)

<u>Volumetric</u> pipette

### How to know water is fully given off

-   Heat, weight, repeat
-   Until mass constant

### How to do flame test

-   Wooden splint with substance
-   Blue flame
-   Put splint into flame
-   Observe colour of flame
