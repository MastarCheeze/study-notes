# Redox reaction

> Simultaneous oxidation and reduction

| Oxidation          | Reduction          |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Gain oxygen        | Lose oxygen        |
| Lose electrons     | Gain electrons     |
| Oxidation number ⬆ | Oxidation number ⬇ |

## Oxidation numbers rules

-   ON of element is 0
-   ON of ion is charge of ion
-   Sum of ON of compound is 0
-   Sum of ON of compound ion is charge of ion

## Common reagents

### Oxidising agent

> Is reduced, causes other substance to oxidise

**Acidified aqueous potassium manganate (VII)** \
When reduced: Purple to colourless

### Reducing agent

> Is oxidised, causes other substance to reduce

**Potassium iodide** \
When oxidised: Colourless to yellow-brown
