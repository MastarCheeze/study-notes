# Reversible Reactions

$$\boxed{\huge\rightleftharpoons}$$

> **Closed system** - No substance can enter or leave during a reaction
>
> **Dynamic equilibrium** \
> \- Rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse reaction \
> \- Concentration of reactants/products constant

## Factors

| Factor                       | Equilibrium shifts to... | Rate of reaction... |

| ⬆ Pressure                   | Less moles               | ⬆                   |

| <nobr>⬆ Concentration</nobr> | Away from substance      | ⬆                   |

When change is made to the conditions \
the system moves to oppose the change
