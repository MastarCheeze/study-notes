2)(a) 5 6 5 ✓
  (b)(i) 20% ✓
     (ii) 2.96*10^22 ✓
  (c)(i) bauxite ✓
     (ii) cryolite ✓
          lower the melting point ✓ and increase electrical conductivity ✓
     (iii) Al3+ + 3e -> Al ✓
     (iv) Oxygen produced react with the carbon ✓ anode to produce carbon dioxide ✓, anode becomes smaller over time
  (d) Light, low density ✓
      Good electric conductivity ✓
  (e) There is a protective layer of unreactive ✓ aluminium oxide ✓ on the surface
  (f)(i) 2Al + 3F2 -> 2AlF3 ✓
     (ii) 3+ - 8✗ 7•1✗ ✓

3)(a)(i) zinc manganese lead silver ✓
     (ii) lead sulfate is insoluble ✓
     (iii) Zn + 2AgNO3 -> 2Ag + Zn(NO3)2 ✓
  (b)(i) colourless -> orange ✓
     (ii) Cl2 + 2Br- -> Br2 + 2Cl- ✓
     (iii) Tenessine

4)(a) glowing wooden splint ✓
      relights ✓
  (b)(i) gradient at t2 is less than t1 ✓
     (ii) lower temperature, less kinetic energy, less collisions and less molecules have energy more than Ea to react ✗
          (ans) concentration of hydrogen peroxide decreases, less rate of collisions
     (iii) steeper gradient, same flat line ✓
  (c) 0.072/24=0.003mol ✓
      0.003*2=0.006mol ✓
      0.006/0.02=0.3mol/dm³ ✓
      RMM=2+16*2=34 ✓
      0.3*34=10.2g/dm³ ✓
  (d) iron (III) oxide ✓

5)(a) Concentrations +of reactants and products+ stay the same ✓
      Rate of forward reaction = rate of backwards reaction ✓
  (b)(i) Decreases ✓, equilibrium shifts to the left where there are less moles of gas ✓
     (ii) Increases ✓, equilibrium shifts to the right where forward reaction is endothermic ✓
     (iii) No change ✓, it only increases speed of reaching equilibrium ✓ (ans) does not affect position of equilibrium
  (c)(i) carbon dioxide ✓
     (ii) when radiation from the sun reaches the earth, it is reflected on the surface of the earth ✓. greenhouse gases absorb ✓ and reflect the heat energy from the radiation, causing temperature to rise ✓.
          (ans) energy from sun absorbed by earth surface
                greenhouse gas reduce thermal energy loss

6)(a) yeast ✓ bacteria
      no oxygen ✓
  (b)(i) 300°C ✓ 6000kPa ✓
